# JavaScript-quiz-game

##Description

This is a Java Script quiz that I am not finished with. I was sick this past week and plan to finish this. I have to submit what I have to be able to submit again. I am sorry this is not finished. I am working on the JS file and adding questions to the quiz. Once I have done this i will link them to the game and put in a timer. After all this I will make the highscore page and make the high scores save to the local storage.
